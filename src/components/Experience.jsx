      <p>
        With more than 10 years of experience at high-growth startups, I thrive
        in a fast-paced, remote-first working environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a natural leader and skilled communicator, I’m at my best when
        leading cross-functional projects from roadmap to release: shaping,
        scoping, and coordinating the work; keeping stakeholders aligned and in
        the loop; and delivering high-quality, well-tested code on time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think strategically and act pragmatically, balancing technical
        tradeoffs with product and business goals to keep projects moving
        forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about building products that users love and that
        engineers are proud of, and I take great joy in mentoring newer
        engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
        My superpowers are discernment, authenticity, clarity, thoroughness,
        reliability, and empathy.
